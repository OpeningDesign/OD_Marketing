Subject:  Open Source Architectural Services

Hi My Name is Ryan Schultz.  I'm an architect from Madison, WI.

In short, I was wondering if [company] is currently looking for any architectural design help.

We (OpeningDesign) are a unique architectural firm, in that, we take pride in realizing architecturally unique projects by pushing the technology and process boundaries associated with Metal Building Systems (MBS).

We don't reinvent the wheel.  Rather, we work closely with the established team to look for creative ways to realize unique designs by innovating on current MBS technologies (BIM) and team processes—all with an eye on staying on or below budget.

Additionally, another entirely unique aspect of our work is the fact that all our deliverables (BIM, CAD, designs) are all open source.   That is, after the project's completion, [company] would be free to reuse and modify them, royalty free, in the future—as long as attribution is given for the work.

To be respectful of your time, I wanted to keep this introductory email short.  Obviously there’s a lot more to discuss, but on a cursory review, I was wondering if you may be interested in chatting.

In the meantime, to get a sense of the caliber of our work, he's two example projects we are currently working on that are under construction.  The BIM/CAD files are free to download and use.
