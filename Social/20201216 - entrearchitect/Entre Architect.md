Hi, I would like to try something different.

*tldr: Looking for work that allows the codevelopment of an open source Revit template.*

As some of you already know, I have developed and maintained the following open source Revit template over the years.

https://gitlab.com/openingdesign/OD_Library/-/blob/master/BIM/OD_Revit_Template%20-%202020.rte

As I hinted on other posts, I would love to work with other architects in this group to co-develop this template together.  A few of you have shown interest.

I assume, however, that adopting someone else's template is hard, because there's a lot of tacit knowledge behind its creation. In essense, you would need someone there to help make heads and tails of it.

In this light, I would like to try something different. 

I was wondering if there's any firms that are both looking for additional help on a project, but are also interested in potentially adopting an existing Revit template as well.

I would like to propose an approach where I could help manage one of your firm's projects, all while helping your firm better understand how to use this template, as well as just helping with Revit in general. 

I have practiced architecture for 25years, and have completed a wide varity of projects size--all from schematic through construction.

My particular skill and passion is harnessing technology to streamline workflows.

I also have a small team that I have worked extensively over the years, that that could also benefit your firm depending on the project size.  We have dialed into a nice, tailored, remote workflow over the years, of which we can also share with your firm.

Also feel free to hire them directly.  I cannot recommend them enough.

I'm excited about this approach. I think it would be great way for a firm to get help with their projects, but at the same time learning how to use an already established template, thus avoid reinventing the wheel.  A template, furthermore, that will only gain in suffictication of the years and will always be open source.

Furthermore, it could be a win/win for firms, in that, I could see the potential of teaming up with other firms that share this template and processes, in order to applying for RFPs that might be outside a single firm's capabilities. 

Would like to hear your thoughts. 

Happy to chat.

All the Best, Ryan
